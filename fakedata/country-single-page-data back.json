          "question": "What is the ideal intake for the UK?",
          "answer": "This depends on the program, level of study, and the institution you're applying to. The September intake is typically the most preferred. For this intake, the majority of universities offer all major courses. While this intake is the most competitive, it’s also the one where you have the most number of seats and programs open. <br><br> Starting your applications early and making sure to submit a thorough and complete package that matches your chosen program’s eligibility criteria boosts your chances of admission. But don’t fret if you miss the Fall intake - the Winter intake is comparable in terms of course availability and a good option to start your program without having to wait another academic year."

          "question": "Is it expensive to study in the UK?",
          "answer": "In comparison to places like the USA, the UK's tuition fees and cost of living objectively seem to be on the higher end. Do your homework to determine your cost expectations, though, as affordability is subjective, depending on your own budget, and can vary considerably based on your needs. And remember, scholarships and education loans can help lighten the financial burden considerably!"

The most prestigious honors given out at any given\r\n          institution are also the hardest to win.

CPT is a part of your curriculum - meaning professional\r\n          experience is a part and prerequisite of completing your degree.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <h3 class='mb-[15px] mt-5 text-primary'>What is OPT?</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Optional Practical Training is a period of time during which F-1\r\n          students who have graduated or been enrolled in their degree program\r\n          for more than nine months are authorized by USCIS to engage in\r\n          practical training related to their field of study. Pre-completion OPT\r\n          involves working while you are a student, whereas post-completion OPT\r\n          refers to work after you complete your program. There is a limit of 12\r\n          months for OPT - meaning if you worked nine months during\r\n          Pre-Completion OPT you can only work for three months for\r\n          Post-Completion OPT. STEM students can extend their stay by 24 months.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          During your first year of university, international students on an F-1\r\n          visa are restricted 20 hours per week to on-campus work. After this\r\n          first year, students can access off-campus work opportunities through\r\n          CPT and OPT.\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3 class='mb-[15px] mt-5 text-primary'>Concluding Thoughts</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          When it comes to higher education, the USA stands out as a top\r\n          destination.

Throughout\r\n          history, universities in Australia have been a breeding ground for\r\n          innovative thinkers and doers. 5 Australian universities make it to\r\n          the top 50 in the QS World University Rankings in 2023. These\r\n          prestigious institutions are among the best in the world when it comes\r\n          to teaching and research.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Australia's diversity</strong> is one of the things that draws\r\n          foreign students to the country. 6 Australian cities rank in the top\r\n          40 of the QS Best Student Cities 2023. Among the reasons contributing\r\n          to these are the cities’ student mix, where Melbourne is leading the\r\n          race! You'll fit right in with the many languages, cultures,\r\n          nationalities, and ethnic groups that make up the world's smallest\r\n          continent.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          <strong>Post-graduation opportunities</strong> are another plus of\r\n          studying in Australia. The country ranks high on the list of nations\r\n          that welcome international students with open arms. If you are\r\n          eligible for a Subclass 485 visa after graduation, you can extend your\r\n          time in Australia from two to four years upon graduation. This lets\r\n          you seek and take advantage of work opportunities and work towards\r\n          permanent residency to call Australia your forever home!\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n    \r\n      <div>\r\n        <h3 class='mb-[15px] mt-5 text-primary'>\r\n          Applying to Australian Universities\r\n        </h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Holding an Australian university degree says a lot about how qualified\r\n          you are as a graduate. To take advantage of this, you need to\r\n          understand the Australian way of higher education. The Australian\r\n          Qualifications Framework (AQF) conceptualizes the different levels of\r\n          higher education in the country. It offers a system that makes it easy\r\n          to translate international academic qualifications to their Australian\r\n          equivalence.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Before enrolling, you also need to verify that your selected degree is\r\n          recognised by CRICOS (the Commonwealth Register of Institutions and\r\n          Courses for Overseas Students). We’ll discuss both in a bit more\r\n          detail below.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n     \r\n      <div>\r\n        <h3 class='mb-[15px] mt-5 text-primary'>What is AQF?</h3>\r\n        <p>\r\n          Australian education and training are governed by the Australian\r\n          Qualifications Framework (AQF), a national policy.
