For this intake, the majority of universities offer all major courses. While this intake is the most competitive, it’s also the one where you have the most number of seats and programs open. <br><br> Starting your applications early and making sure to submit a thorough and complete package that matches your chosen program’s eligibility criteria boosts your chances of admission. But don’t fret if you miss the Fall intake - the Winter intake is comparable in terms of course availability and a good option to start your program without having to wait another academic year."

Do your homework to determine your cost expectations, though, as affordability is subjective, depending on your own budget, and can vary considerably based on your needs. And remember, scholarships and education loans can help lighten the financial burden considerably!"
