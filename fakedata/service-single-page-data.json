This means you\n    don’t have to repeat training you’ve already received. An additional bonus\n    is that the entire RPL process is online!\n  </p>\n  <h4>What is RPL?</h4>\n  <p>\n    Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) recognises learning experiences gained\n    through life and work. The RPL process consists of merging your current\n    experience to a nationally recognised qualification or statement of\n    attainment.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Certify You will recognise your experience and overseas qualifications by\n    filling in the gaps to fast track your skills into becoming a nationally\n    recognised qualification.

With just 4 easy steps we will save you time and money so\n    you can receive formal acknowledgement of your skills.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    We are partnered with a selection of Registered Training Organisations (RTO)\n    and offer you a variety of Nationally Recognised Qualifications that will\n    help get you that promotion, get that Trade License, or get going in a new\n    Industry – whatever your motive in seeking RPL, let us help you get\n    certified!\n  </p>\n  <h4>How It Works</h4>\n  <h5>Step 1: Contact us for a skills assessment</h5>\n  <p>\n    We will discuss your goals and your experience to help you gain the right\n    qualifications that will correspond to your skills.\n  </p>\n\n  <h5>Step 2: Verification of your experience</h5>\n  <p>\n    To verify your experience, we’ll be needing copies of your Curriculum Vitae\n    (CV), letter of employment, current contracts, reference letters, and any\n    certificates and transcripts that demonstrate your competencies.\n  </p>\n\n  <h5>Step 3: Skills assessment</h5>\n  <p>\n    Complete an online skills assessment to acknowledge your work capabilities\n    and use these to impact either partially or completely towards your\n    nationally recognised qualifications. This way you can better understand\n    where your skills can take you.\n  </p>\n\n  <h5>Step 4: You are now certified!</h5>\n  <p>\n    All our certifications are nationally recognised and are issued by Certify\n    You, partnered with a selection of Registered Training Organisations (RTO)!\n  </p>\n\n  <h4>RPL Qualifications</h4>\n\n  <h4>Automotive</h4>\n  <ul class=\"mb-5\">\n    <li>Certificate II in Automotive Air Conditioning Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate II in Automotive Electrical Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate II in Automotive Servicing Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate II in Automotive Tyre Servicing Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Automotive Electrical Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Light Vehicle Mechanical Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Motorcycle Mechanical Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Automotive Sales</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Heavy Commercial Vehicle Mechanical Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Automotive Underbody Technology</li>\n    <li>AUR40212 Certificate IV in Automotive Mechanical Diagnosis</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h4>Beauty</h4>\n  <ul class=\"mb-5\">\n    <li>Certificate II in Nail Technology</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Beauty Therapy</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Beauty Therapy</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <h4>Business</h4>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Certificate III in Business</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Customer Contact</li>\n    <li>Certificate III in Business Administration</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Business</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Customer Contact</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Business Administration</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Business Administration</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Business Sales</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Frontline Management</li>\n    <li>Certificate IV in Work Health and Safety</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Business</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Customer Contact</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Business Administration</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Human Resources Management</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Management</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Project Management</li>\n    <li>Diploma of Quality Auditing</li>\n    <li>Advanced Diploma of Management</li>\n    <li>Advanced Diploma of Marketing</li>\n  </ul>\n</div>",
