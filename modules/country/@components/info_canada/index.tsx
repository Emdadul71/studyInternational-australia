        <p>
          Work opportunities in Canada for students are vast. The majority of
          universities offer co-op programmes and job placements to help you
          gain this practical experience. Programs themselves are structured
          according to industry trends and demands. If your study permit is
          still in effect, you are permitted to work full- or part-time on and
          off campus. Students can work 20 hours a week part-time, and work
          full-time when classes are on break. Some part-time positions for
          students are as follows:
        </p>

        <p className="mt-4">
          After finishing your program, you are also eligible for post-study
          opportunities through the Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). If you
          successfully apply for the PGWP, you can continue to live and work in
          Canada after completing your program. The length of your stay will
          depend on the duration of the program. If the program is:

        <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
          <li>
