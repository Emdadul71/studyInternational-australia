          US universities, like those in other popular study abroad

        </h3>
        <p>
          The availability of scholarships is a key consideration while
          selecting a university. If securing a scholarship is crucial to your
          study abroad goals, you should devote much time and effort to the
          process. The most prestigious honors given out at any given
          institution are also the hardest to win. By diversifying and narrowing
          your scholarship hunt, you can increase your success rate. Some
          scholarships in the USA for internationals students are as follows:
        </p>

          If you want to study in the United States as an international or
          nonimmigrant student, you'll need an F-1 student visa. After

          applying for the F-1 student visa. Let's take a look at the
          requirements:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-4">
          <li>Passport with validity of 6 months</li>
          <li>Original and signed Form I-20 and SEVIS ID</li>

          Work Opportunities in the USA for International Students
        </h3>
        <p>
          As an international student in the USA, you have the option of getting
          work experience in the USA through CPT or OPT. Both CPT and OPT have
          to be related to the field you are studying in the USA.
        </p>
        <h3 className="mb-[15px] mt-5 text-primary">What is CPT?</h3>
        <p className="mt-4">
          Curricular Practical Training allows non-immigrant foreign students
          studying at a US college or university to work temporarily while in
          the country. CPT is a part of your curriculum - meaning professional
          experience is a part and prerequisite of completing your degree.
        </p>
        <h3 className="mb-[15px] mt-5 text-primary">What is OPT?</h3>
        <p>
          Optional Practical Training is a period of time during which F-1
          students who have graduated or been enrolled in their degree program
          for more than nine months are authorized by USCIS to engage in
          practical training related to their field of study. Pre-completion OPT
          involves working while you are a student, whereas post-completion OPT
          refers to work after you complete your program. There is a limit of 12
          months for OPT - meaning if you worked nine months during
          Pre-Completion OPT you can only work for three months for
          Post-Completion OPT. STEM students can extend their stay by 24 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          During your first year of university, international students on an F-1
          visa are restricted 20 hours per week to on-campus work. After this
          first year, students can access off-campus work opportunities through
          CPT and OPT.
        </p>
